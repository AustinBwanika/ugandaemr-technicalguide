The Future is now. The idea of robots living among humans is becoming a conversation that has crossed the minds of many and the opportunity to indulge in the topic of robotics engineering would help feed my desire to understand the future that is being built in front of us. By participating in this summer program on Robotics engineering I would hope to learn a new aspect of life in an ever-expanding world that we live in. 

My AS level studies, in computer science, have helped spark the thought of how programming has endless possibilities in the world and how programming is a vital part of robotics which made me realize that the idea of robots living amongst humans is a real possibility within the world through the fast-growing world of Computer science. Through attending the summer program, I would hope to understand more about how robots are built and the process behind their structure so I can gain a basic understanding of what happens in the creation of such machines.
 In physics we learn how the electrical components connect to each other in different ways to help create a circuit which fascinates me in how all these stand-alone components can work together to bring out pre-determined outcome. From this I have developed the skill on precision through the practicalâ€™s that we would do in class and this skill will help me through this course where when asked to do research or when recoding results the data retrieved will be precise.

In conclusion the summer program is an ideal program to be in because of the insight it gives into being a university student and how the world around us is ever changing so as humans we need to keep up.
